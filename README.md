## Details

This website is base on the [pwa-starter-kit](https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit), pragrammed with [lit-element](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element), [Material Design](https://material.io/).

We have 5 modules on the homepage: Men's Outerwear, Ladies Outerwear, Men's T-Shirts, Ladies T-Shirts and My Account (which means shopping cart actually).

*MISE EN OEUVRE DE MATERIAL DESIGN*

For MDC, we used them everywhere. However, it seems that they didn't display in an ideal way. 
But we used, we definitely use them!!! (Since the typer, I, here don't understand the details of this box in french, let's review it on Monday.)

*CONTENU DE L'APPLICATION*

Page principale: oups, we just noticed this page... can we just say that it's a shopping web page, so the principal page is directly a product page? 

Navigation: we do have 5 buttons on the top of the website.

Galerie de produits: bingo!

Fiche produits: Well, honestly, we didn't get enough time to finish the product detail's page, but we ... link magically to an example shopping web. Howerver, we uploaded the "my-detail.js" inside ./src/componnents/ .

Panier: we have a stupid panier on "my account" page...if you like, I can put all the product's titles on the list. let's see and talk.

....the typer is tired of typing. see you.
